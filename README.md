## Simon's sequence

#### 1. At the start of each level 'simon' will flash one single colour button in a random order each with a corresponding sound.
#### 2. Player must now repeat and press the same button that 'simon' flashed up. Correctly pressed button lights up and player moves to the next level.
#### 3. Each new level will add a new random button to the previous sequence.
#### 4. Player must continue to repeat increasing sequences correctly in order to move to the next level.

## Game over 

#### The game ends when a player makes a mistake in repeating the sequence. 

## Good luck!
